        <p class="small"><strong>Always backup your keys: </strong> MyEtherWallet.com &amp; MyEtherWallet CX are not "web wallets". You do not create an account or give us your funds to hold onto. No data leaves your computer / your browser. We make it easy for you to create, save, and access your information and interact with the blockchain.</p>

        <p class="small"><strong>We are not responsible for any loss: </strong> Ethereum, MyEtherWallet.com & MyEtherWallet CX, and some of the underlying Javascript libraries we use are under active development. While we have thoroughly tested &amp; tens of thousands of wallets have been successfully created by people all over the globe, there is always the possibility something unexpected happens that causes your funds to be lost. Please do not invest more than you are willing to lose, and please be careful.</p>
